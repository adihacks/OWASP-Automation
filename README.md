jQuery teller automates the process of finding owasp top 10 bug (A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components).
This tool can be used to tell what si the libraries version and which cves its vunerbale to and respective fixes:)
OWASP TOP 10 -
A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components was previously titled Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities and is #2 in the Top 10 community survey, but also had enough data to make the Top 10 via data analysis. This category moves up from #9 in 2017 and is a known issue that we struggle to test and assess risk. It is the only category not to have any Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVEs) mapped to the included CWEs, so a default exploit and impact weights of 5.0 are factored into their scores.
